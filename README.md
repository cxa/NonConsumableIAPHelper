Tried of writing non-consumable In App Purchase again and again? To seek a minimum library that doesn't suck? Here you are.

`NonConsumableIAPHelper` is a very simple wrapper for non-consumable In App Purchase, only one method to rule them all:

	+ (void)purchaseProductWithID:(NSString *)productID completionHandler:(void (^)(BOOL isRestored))completionHandler errorHandler:(void (^)(NSError *error))errorHandler;
